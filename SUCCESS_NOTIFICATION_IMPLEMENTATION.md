# Success Notification Implementation

This document describes the implementation of success notifications with timers in the form submission workflow.

## Changes Made

### 1. FormContainer.vue
- Added new props for success notification configuration:
  - `successMessage` (String, default: 'Form submitted successfully!')
  - `showSuccessNotification` (Boolean, default: true)
  - `successNotificationTimer` (Number, default: 3000)
- Updated the handleSubmit function to show a SweetAlert2 notification on successful form submission
- Configured the notification to automatically close after the specified timer duration
- Removed the OK button requirement for the success notification

### 2. Form.vue
- Added pass-through props for success notification configuration
- Updated the template to pass these props to FormContainer

### 3. Create.vue and Edit.vue
- Updated components to use the new success notification props
- Set specific success messages for user creation and editing
- Configured the timer to 3 seconds as requested

## Configuration

The success notification is configured with the following settings:
- Title: "Success"
- Icon: Success icon
- Timer: 3000ms (3 seconds)
- Show Confirm Button: false (no button required)
- Timer Progress Bar: true (shows visual progress of the timer)

## Usage

To use the success notification in a form:

```vue
<Form
  :show-success-notification="true"
  success-message="Custom success message"
  :success-notification-timer="3000"
/>
```

## Benefits

1. Provides immediate feedback to users on successful form submission
2. Automatically dismisses after 3 seconds without requiring user interaction
3. Shows a visual progress bar to indicate when the notification will close
4. Maintains consistency with the existing error notification system
5. Fully customizable through props
